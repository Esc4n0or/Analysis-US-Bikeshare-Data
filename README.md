# Analysis-US-Bikeshare-Data

## About the project...
- It's a project about US-bikeshare in the 3 major cities ('New York city', 'Chicago', 'Washington').
- Since we want to analysis 3 cities, We are going to deal with 3 datasets each for every city.
- Columns in each Data are: 1.Start Time 2.End Time 3.Trip Duration 4.Start Station 5.End Station 6.User Type 7.Birth Year 8.Gender (Last 2 columns are just in Chicago and New York city datasets).

## Requirements...
- Python and its Libraries (Numpy, Pandas).
- Text Editor and Terminal to test the project.

## I was able to answer about...
- What month occurs most often in the start time?
- What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time? 
- What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?
- What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
- What is the most frequently used start station and most frequently used end station?
- What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station that occurs the most often)?
- What are the counts of each user type?
- What are the counts of gender?
- What is the earliest birth year (when the oldest person was born), most recent birth year, and most common birth year?
